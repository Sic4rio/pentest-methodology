# Pentest Methodology

This repo will contain checklists with common tactics for penetration tests. It is by no means exhaustive and is not a replacement for the PTES or OWASP testing guide. The intent is to provide an extremely high-level guide to help a tester stay on track.

In most real-life engagements, there will be many other tactics that should be employed based on the observed environment.

Feel free to submit ideas and suggestions.

# Project Status
This is in early development - please bear with me in regards to lots of little commits here and there.
